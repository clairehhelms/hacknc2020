Repository for HackNC project by Fernando Garcia, Jenn Kang, and Claire Helms

This project is based off of the idea of speed-dating. The idea is to match language students and teachers to engage in enriching, short conversations to aid in learning new languages. 

The problem with other language-learning apps and websites is that one-on-one conversation cannot happen with live speech, and often, conversations get into a rut by repetetive introductions and basic questions.

We definitely want to expand this project to include a profile page and matching criteria based on experience and interests. We also want to create three tracks for users: student, teacher, and combination. These tracks dictate which role you will play in a conversation: native speaker or learner. We would also like to incorporate an incentive-based points system based off of conversation participation. 

We learned so much in this project. Fernando and Claire learned the basics of HTML, running sites locally, and Flask (a Python extension). Jenn learned how to implement open source projects and utilize Youtube videos to aid my understanding of various programming languages and extensions. She learned how to write JavaScript and the JSON data format. We all learned how to work as a team and began to bring our conceptual ideas into tangible reality through programming!
